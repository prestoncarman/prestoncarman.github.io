# Course Material

As a new teacher, textbooks were my life line for getting up to speed on a topic and for structuring my class.
A good textbook supports student learning and provides an outline to how course topics can be taught.
It shows what topics build on each other and gives examples to build on in class.

Once a schedule and topics have been selected for a class, other supporting activities can be selected.
[POGIL activities](https://www.pogil.org/about-pogil/what-is-pogil) support group student learning.
A group supported by the National Science Foundation have made Computer Science POGIL activities available at <https://cspogil.org/>.
A list of POGIL activities can be found in a post titled "[Course Activities](course-activities)".

The following is a list of courses I have taught with textbooks and other material helpful in running these courses.

title:  "Course Activities"
---

As a new teacher, textbooks were my life line for getting up to speed on a topic structuring my class.
A good textbook supports student learning and provides an outline to how course topics can be taught.
It shows what topics build on each other and gives examples to build on in class.

Once a schedule and topics have been selected for a class, other supporting activities can be selected.
[POGIL activities](https://www.pogil.org/about-pogil/what-is-pogil) support group student learning.
A group supported by the National Science Foundation have made Computer Science POGIL activities available at <https://cspogil.org/>.

## Activity Modifications

My modifications have been focused on making consistent documents for our students.
These activities have been migrated to Latex and include a "Recorder's Report".
The individual activities build the example [cspogil](https://github.com/ChrisMayfield/cspogil) git repository.
Primarily expanding support for the C++ language in the `cspogil.sty` file.
To allow students to keep the written handout, we have each group turn in a single page of select answers for the activity.

Notes about other modifications are listed with the activity.

## Courses and Activity List

The following is a list of courses that have been taught with POGIL activities.
Each course lists the sequence of activities and a link to the original source.
